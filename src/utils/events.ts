            <li>4. Your striker should not be placed half on the baseline and half on the baseline circle. Rather, it should either be fully within the baseline or be fully within the baseline circle. In short, cutting the moon is prohibited.</li>
            <li>5. In order to make the striker cross the front part of the baseline and hit the carrommen, you ought to flick the striker with only one finger.</li>
            <li>6. You cannot flick the striker in the backward or horizontal direction.</li>
            <li>7. While attempting a stroke, you cannot let your hand or arm cross the diagonal lines that are known as foul lines.</li>
            <li>8. You are allowed three attempts to break the cluster of carrommen on your first turn.</li>
            <li>9. In case you strike and luckily pocket as well as cover the queen, you get points and retain the striker.</li>
            <li>10. After the first turn is over and the cluster of pieces/carrommen is scattered, you should neither fail to pocket your carromman nor fall prey to improper stroke. In either case, your turn will end.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>

            <ul>
            <li>You can pocket the queen only after you have pocketed at least one of your carrommen.</li>
            <li>If, during the process of breaking the cluster of pieces, you only pocket the queen, it is returned to the center.</li>
            <li>If you pocket the queen before pocketing any of your own carrommen, the queen is returned to the center while you retain the turn.</li>
            <li>Pocketing the queen after pocketing at least one of your carrommen is considered legal.</li>
            <li>Pocketing and covering the queen simultaneously grants points, regardless of which piece enters the pocket first.</li>

            <h3><b>Position Rules:</b></h3>
            <h4>Rules for the Position of Pieces and strikers after they leave the board or get entangled. </h4>
            <p>During the course of play, some pieces and the striker may take awkward positions or may go out of the board and fall on the ground.
            Let‚Äôs see what the rules for such situations are:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>1. In case a piece has overtaken another piece, you cannot reposition them with bare hands. Rather you have to separate them by means of strokes.</li>
            <li>2. In case any piece, either yours or that of your opponent‚Äôs, has fallen down from the board, you can simply take that and place it in the center of the board.</li>
            <li>3. If a piece is positioned on the edge of the board, you cannot settle it with your hands. Rather, you have to consider it in play; hence, strike it with the striker.</li>
            <li>4. In case your striker is entangled under some pieces or even comes under only one piece, you can remove the striker without causing much displacement of the pieces/piece. After all, it is the striker with which you have to continue your game. </li>
